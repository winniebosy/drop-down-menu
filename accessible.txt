Use fly-out (or drop-down) menus to provide an overview of a web site’s page hierarchy. It removes the need for multiple page loads provided that users know where to find the information. Application menus are implemented similarly, but with additional WAI-ARIA markup.
The WAI-ARIA markup aria-expanded="false" declares that the submenu navigation is presently hidden, or “collapsed”.
<nav></nav> can be placed inside the header element if the links to be used are not linked to an external webpage. But if it is for crusing webpage within a webasite, then it can be placed.
